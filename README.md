- Using the GitHub API, I gathered data on users in Beijing with over 500 followers, retrieving each userâ€™s profile information and up to 500 recent public repositories. This involved processing data fields such as user names, bios, and repository details like languages used, star counts, and license information into organized CSV files.

- A surprising discovery from the data analysis was that a large portion of high-follower users in Beijing primarily work with JavaScript, suggesting that this language is a prominent focus within the local developer community, likely driven by web development and frontend projects where JavaScript has broad applicability and popularity.

- Based on the analysis, developers in Beijing who aim to expand their networks and professional visibility should prioritize contributing to popular JavaScript open-source projects, as collaboration on widely-used repositories can foster connections and enhance recognition in the tech community.
